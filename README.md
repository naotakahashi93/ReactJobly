# Jobly

Jobly is a mock job posting website that lets users (job seekers) search and apply for job openings. The website is built using Node.js as the back end and React as the front end. Job names/company names were used from a custom API provided by the school. 

## Features

- Users can register and login (using JWT)
- Users can filter through a list of jobs and companies using search terms and other filters such as "maximum employees" or "minimum salary".
- Applied jobs are saved onto SQL Database and are displayed on user profile page.


## Usage

To use the website, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and go to `https://reactjobly.surge.sh/`.
2. Signup or login (demo login - username: test15, password:test15) 
3. Browse through "Jobs" tab or Companies tab, optionally add filters
4. Click on "Apply"
5. Applied job will appear on "Profile" tab, option to edit details here. 
6. Option to apply for jobs by company, click on a company and job openings are listed- apply button will appear when specific job is clicked on.

## Tech Stack 

For the tech stack for this project I used Node.js as the backend and React for the front-end. I used Axios for making HTTP/API requests and React Router DOM for routing. The project uses a SQL database for storing data, and it is deployed on Heroku and Surge. Additionally, the logo was custom-made by me using Canva.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
